If a Steam store page contains an _AI Generated Content Disclosure_, this userscript will display it as a modal popup, instead of just at the end of the page. Additionally it will blur out the rest of the page until the popup is dismissed.

## Installation

1. If necessary, install a userscript manager for your browser, for example by following the instructions at [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/#home-step-1).
2. [Click here to install the userscript](https://github.com/seeeeew/aiwarningforsteam/raw/refs/heads/main/aiwarningforsteam.user.js) _or_ download [`aiwarningforsteam.user.js`](https://github.com/seeeeew/aiwarningforsteam/blob/main/aiwarningforsteam.user.js) to install it manually.

## Platform Support

This userscript should work in any up-to-date browser with userscript support on any OS, on both desktop and mobile, and in any language officially supported by the Steam store.

## Project Scope

This userscript's sole purpose is making the _AI Generated Content Disclosure_ impossible to miss on Steam store pages where it exists. Future updates might improve this functionality, but will not add unrelated features.
